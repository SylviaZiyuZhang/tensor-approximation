### Environment Setup
The tensor algebra library and benchmark used here is xerus `libxerus.org`. To compile and run the code, you need to have C++>=11 locally, and build and link to the xerus library. See `libxerus.org/building_xerus/`.

Once the library is set up, run `make test` to compile the test code. Run `make benchmark` to compile the benchmark code.
